# Introduction

I have picked the FE part of the project. I have completed both parts of the test.

I have used following plugins and tools with reasons.

- React: React is easy to setup and use
- Jest : Jest works best with react
- styled-component: React is component based framework and in my opinion styled components is the best styling approach to a component based library
- cypress: Tests are written in js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
